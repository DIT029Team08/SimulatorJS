    <div style="margin-left: 40px">
        <h2>getJSON(String path, Object json)</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            Takes the path of a JSON file and parses it, creating an
            object of the json text.<br> The JSON object is then read to
            create HTML elements out of the objects needed to output
            the Sequence Diagram.<br><br>
            In the context of the DIT029 Format, we can take the example
            of the Processes (Objects in the SSD).<br> The function iterates
            through the array and creates a "div" element and appends it
            as a child of the Animation Panel in animationPage.html.<br><br>
            Furthermore, it creates another "div" and appends it to the
            previous "div" in order to later style it into a UML lifeline.<br>
            Finally, after very iteration, it will check whether or not the 
            element being created is the last one or not.<br> If not, the function
            will create another "div" and append it as a child of the main panel.
            This is done to simplify the CSS layout.<br>
            N.B: The three constant variables (see below) are used to change the name of the
            classes of the elements in HTML. This has consequences at runtime and
            within the CSS implementation, do not change this unless you know what
            you are doing.<br>

        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
			This function is responsible for parsing the JSON File nodes in its entirety.
			It takes two parameters, a JSON Object (this could also be an array) as well as the frame
			to append the nodes to.<br>
 
			It is called recursively after each node creation and stops once the parsing is done.
			The initial JSON must have at least one "send" node otherwise the function will hang
