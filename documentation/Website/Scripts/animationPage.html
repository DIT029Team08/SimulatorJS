        <h2>$restart.click(function (e))</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            Emits 'begin animation' to the server once clicked. The sever then responds by emitting 'begin animation'
            to all clients, thus starting the animation process. The client that clicked the button is marked as a
            submitter by changing the boolean isSubmitter to true.

            When clicked, and if the last diagram shown was not a Sequence Diagram, 'begin animation' is emitted

        <h2>socket.on("begin animation", function (data, socketIds))</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            If a 'begin animation' emit is received from the server, outputAnimation() is called from animator.js to
            start the animation process on this client. Data from the JSON uploaded is received as well as an array
            of socket IDs.

            If $nameButton is clicked and the name is not empty, the user is shown the chat interface $chatArea.
            'new user' is emitted to the server along with the name inputted by the user.

    <div style="margin-left: 40px">
        <h2>socket.on('new message', function(data))</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            If a 'new message' emit is received, the data received with it is appended to the chat ($messageBox).
            The data displays the message written by a client as well as that client's name.
        </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px">
        <h2>socket.on('arrow reply', function (data))</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            If an 'arrow reply' emit was received, then the server is informing this client to draw a new arrow
            requested by the submitter.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            The client first checks the objectIndex variable, if it is 0, then this client needs to make some decisions
            about the processes of the Sequence Diagram before moving on to animating them. The client checks the
            ID of each process and compares it to its own ID. If there is a match, the process is coloured black
            to show that it is possessed by this client.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            The client retrieves data about the arrow based on the JSON uploaded by the submitter and animates the arrow
            based on the starting and ending pixel positions. This is done so that the client knows which arrow to draw:
            an arrow going from left to right, an arrow going from right to left, or a self call arrow.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            Lastly, the length of objectIndex is checked to see if this will be the last arrow to be requested from the
            submitter. If so, isSubmitter boolean is changed to false for the submitter. A new submitter is chosen when
            one of the clients chooses to start an animation.
        </p>

    <hr>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px">
        <h2>serverRequest()</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            This function is called in animator.js on every iteration of every arrow. Even though all clients call
            this function, only the client that started the animation acts on it. Hence, the submitter emits
            'arrow request' to the server which sends it to all clients to create the arrow.
