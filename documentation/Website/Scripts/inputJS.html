            The main role of input.js is to give the file inputted by the user to the rest of the system. The extensions
            the user is allowed to submit are specified in the variable regTypesAllowed. If the user inputs an
            extension not stated in regTypedAllowed, then it will be ignored.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            If the extension is stated, the file is read using FileReader. The result of reading the file, which will be
            a string of the JSON, will be stored in local storage.
